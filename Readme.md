Objective:
The code defines an Apache Airflow DAG that performs a series of data extraction, processing, and storage tasks related to news data from Google News. The goal is to retrieve news articles, analyze their sentiment, save the data to Google Cloud Storage, and visualize sentiment scores in a plot.
This pipeline can be scheduled to run daily and is designed for monitoring news sentiment on specific topics.

Code Overview:

The code imports various libraries and modules, including requests, pandas, os, json, re, nltk, and several Airflow-related modules, as well as the GoogleNews API. It sets up the environment variable for Google Cloud Service Account credentials.

The code defines several functions:

- get_tokens(newsfeed): Cleans text by tokenizing, lowercasing, and removing stopwords.
- get_scores(df): Calculates sentiment scores for news articles using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
- extract_entities(txt): Extracts named entities from a given text file.
- setup_engine(period, subject): Fetches news articles using the GoogleNews API, processes the data, and saves it to a Parquet file.
- save_to_gcs(**context): Uploads the Parquet file to Google Cloud Storage.
- view_scores(**context): Generates a plot displaying sentiment scores of news articles by day and saves it as an HTML file.

It sets up the default arguments for the Airflow DAG, including the owner, start date, and other configuration parameters.

The code defines a dictionary my_variables that contains two variables: '10d' for the time period and 'Israel Hamas Conflict' for the subject of interest.

The Airflow DAG is created with the name 'first_dag_SR', a description, and a schedule interval of once a day at 12 PM.

Three PythonOperator tasks are defined and linked together:

task1 (task_id: 'extract_and_load_to_df') calls the setup_engine function to retrieve news articles, perform sentiment analysis, and save the data as a Parquet file.
task2 (task_id: 'save_to_gcs') calls the save_to_gcs function to upload the Parquet file to Google Cloud Storage.
task3 (task_id: 'view_scores') calls the view_scores function to create a sentiment score plot and save it as an HTML file.
The code represents a data pipeline within an Apache Airflow DAG, which automates the process of retrieving, analyzing, storing, and visualizing news data related to a specified subject. The DAG is scheduled to run daily at 12 PM.
